# 🐾 Oxford-IIIT Pet Classification with Transfer Learning

This project applies **transfer learning** using a Swin Transformer model to classify cat and dog breeds from the **Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset**.  
It uses a pre-trained model, fine-tunes it on pet images, and evaluates the performance with standard deep learning metrics.
